# rental-pricing-explore

## Project Intro/Objective
Recently, a real estate company that has acquired various rental properties in Taipei City has contracted out your firm to extract an analysis of the housing market.

To achieve this, your team has been tasked with analyzing and predicting an in-house dataset your client collected to determine how much they should charge for their properties. Your coworker has completed some basic steps to this pipeline but now relies on your Python knowledge and documentation-reading skills to complete the rest.

## Project Description
The project entails coming up with prices that they should sell their properties for in order to turn a profit. We are in charge of coming up with the prices using the data provided for us to come up with certain statistical analysis to predict the prices for particular properties. 

We first have to explore the data of what is given to us to understand what it is about, the story it is telling us and what we are trying to gain from the data. Then we have to clean the data because there is a lot of irrelevent information and missing data that we need to come up with a solution to the problem we have at hand. Finally, we have to apply what we learned from the data with some statistical models to come up with the solution and present to the client. 

We used histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, and correlation heat maps to give us a visualization of the data. We then use pandas technologies to manipulate the data to make sure it is free from irrelevant information and things that are not needed to come up with a more clean and sleek dataset. Finally, we just used Linear Regression to train the data and give us predictions to give us prices for the real estate company to sell their homes.
